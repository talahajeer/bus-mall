            BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest… before
            actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.

            To make this market analysis maximally effective, BusMall wants you to build an app that displays potential
            products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side) so you’ll need to
            manage the size and the aspect ratio of the images.

            The app’s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that
            they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

            To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, you have been instructed to not allow any
            results to be shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made.

            The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times
            that an item was clicked when it was shown. So, you’ll also need to keep track of how many times each image
            is displayed and do the calculations.
